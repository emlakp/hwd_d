# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental scripts, notebooks, and configurations that are not part of the main codebase.

## Directory Structure

- **`configs/`** - Experimental training configurations
- **`scripts/`** - Debug and analysis scripts
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks for debugging and visualization
- **`analysis/`** - Analysis and plotting scripts

## Contents

### Analysis Scripts
- Gradient analysis and visualization
- Training plot generation
- Loss component breakdowns
- Model profiling tools

### Debug Scripts
- Dataset loading tests
- Model architecture debugging
- Shape mismatch investigations
- Task prediction analysis

### Configs
- Debug training configurations
- Experimental model variants (LSTM, task prediction, etc.)

## Note

These files are excluded from the main git tracking as they are temporary or experimental in nature. If you need to preserve specific experiments, create a dedicated branch or document the approach in the main codebase.
